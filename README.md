# Dynamic Programming in C#
 This is my attempt at learning dynamic programming in C#

### Memoization Technique
1. Make it work
    - Visualize the problem as a tree
    - Implement the tree as a recursion
    - Test
2. Make it efficient
    - Add a memo object (Array, Dictionary, Object)
    - Add a base case for return values
    - Add return values to memo object

### Tabulation Technique
- Visualize the problem as a table
- Size the table based on inputs
- Initialize the table with default values
- Seed the trivial answer into the table
- Iterate through the table
- Fill further positions based on curren position
