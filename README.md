# Dynamic Programming in C#
 This is my attempt at learning dynamic programming in C#

### Memoization Technique
1. Make it work
    - Visualize the problem as a tree
    - Implement the tree as a recursion
    - Test
2. Make it efficient
    - Add a memo object (Array, Dictionary, Object)
    - Add a base case for return values
    - Add return values to memo object
