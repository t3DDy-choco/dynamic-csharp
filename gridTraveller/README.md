# 2D Grid Traveller
Here we saw how many ways we can travel in a 2D grid, and then generalized it to being similar to the fibonacci problem. It was optimized in a similar way using the memoized solution.

> The revKey check actually makes this even faster because the Value for [row, column] is same for [column, row]
